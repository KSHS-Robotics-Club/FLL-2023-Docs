## V 0.0.1
Robot designed, elevator on side of robot. Elevator was heavy with no counterweight so the robot was unbalanced and sank to one side. 
Robot has tank tracks, with red parts added to increase friction.
Robot had elevator on side in order to complete certain missions.

## V 0.0.2
Robot changed to have elevator at the front, which increases the stablity of the robot. 
We determined that the same misisons could be completed with elevator at front after some testing.

## V 0.0.3
Change from tank tracks to wheels (Tracks were bumpy and unstable)
Wheels provide more grip

## V 0.0.4
Changed the back wheels to ball modules because the back wheels were causing unnecessary friction and making the robot not turn easily.

## V 0.0.5 
Changed the front wheels to large wheels from lego mindstorms set 9794.
These wheels provide less friction and allow the robot to turn easier
Increased the elevation of the back wheel ball modules to make the robot level to the ground. This increases stability.

## V 0.0.6
Elevator re-enforced to robot at the front of the robot.

## V 0.0.7
Re-enforced wheels to reduce shaking.

## V 0.0.8
Added counterweight to right wheel to balance both sides.

## V 0.0.9
Added ev3 brick to the back to balance the weight of the elevator at the front. 
Re-enforced brick so that it is held in position on the robot.

## V 0.1.0
Right motor is plugged into port C
Left motor is plugged into port B
Elevator motor is plugged into port A

## V 0.1.1 
Shortened the extension of the elevator platform

## V 0.1.2
Moved the brick from the back of the robot to the middle. This centralises the centre of gravity.
The centre of gravity should be close to the centre of the robot to provide more balance. 

## V 0.1.3
Created a new front extension that is a slope so that it can complete mission 13.
