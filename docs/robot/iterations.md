## V 0.0.1
Robot designed, elevator on side of robot. Elevator was heavy with no counterweight so the robot was unbalanced and sank to one side. 
Robot has tank tracks, with red parts added to increase friction.
Robot had elevator on side in order to complete certain missions.

## V 0.0.2
Robot changed to have elevator at the front, which increases the stablity of the robot. 
We determined that the same misisons could be completed with elevator at front after some testing.

## V 0.0.3
Change from tank tracks to wheels (Tracks were bumpy and unstable)
Wheels provide more grip

## V 0.0.4
Changed the back wheels to ball modules because the back wheels were causing unnecessary friction and making the robot not turn easily.

## V 0.0.5 
Changed the front wheels to large wheels from lego mindstorms set 9794.
These wheels provide less friction and allow the robot to turn easier
Increased the elevation of the back wheel ball modules to make the robot level to the ground. This increases stability.
